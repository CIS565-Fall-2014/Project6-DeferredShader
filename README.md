CIS565: Project 6 -- Deferred Shader
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fall 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due Wed, 11/12/2014 at Noon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project requires any graphics card with support for a modern OpenGL 
pipeline. Any AMD, NVIDIA, or Intel card from the past few years should work 
fine, and every machine in the SIG Lab and Moore 100 is capable of running 
this project.

This project also requires a WebGL capable browser. The project is known to 
have issues with Chrome on windows, but Firefox seems to run it fine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, you will get introduced to the basics of deferred shading. You will write GLSL and OpenGL code to perform various tasks in a deferred lighting pipeline such as creating and writing to a G-Buffer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Project5 root directory contains the following subdirectories:
	
* js/ contains the javascript files, including external libraries, necessary.
* assets/ contains the textures that will be used in the second half of the
  assignment.
* resources/ contains the screenshots found in this readme file.

 This Readme file edited as described above in the README section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The keyboard controls are as follows:
WASDRF - Movement (along w the arrow keys)
* W - Zoom in
* S - Zoom out
* A - Left
* D - Right
* R - Up
* F - Down
* ^ - Up
* v - Down
* < - Left
* > - Right
* 1 - World Space Position
* 2 - Normals
* 3 - Color
* 4 - Depth
* 0 - Blinn-Phong
* 5 - Toon
* 6 - SSAO toggle
* 7 - Bloom toggle
There are also mouse controls for camera rotation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
* Either of the following effects
  * Bloom
  * "Toon" Shading (with basic silhouetting)
* Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
* Diffuse and Blinn-Phong shading
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING THE CODE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the code attempts to access files that are local to your computer, you
will either need to:

* Run your browser under modified security settings, or
* Create a simple local server that serves the files


FIREFOX: change ``strict_origin_policy`` to false in about:config 

CHROME:  run with the following argument : `--allow-file-access-from-files`

(You can do this on OSX by running Chrome from /Applications/Google
Chrome/Contents/MacOS with `open -a "Google Chrome" --args
--allow-file-access-from-files`)

* To check if you have set the flag properly, you can open chrome://version and
  check under the flags

RUNNING A SIMPLE SERVER: 

If you have Python installed, you can simply run a simple HTTP server off your
machine from the root directory of this repository with the following command:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All students must replace or augment the contents of this Readme.md in a clear 
manner with the following:

* A brief description of the project and the specific features you implemented.
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A 30 second or longer video of your project running.  To create the video you
  can use [Open Broadcaster Software](http://obsproject.com) 
* A performance evaluation (described in detail below).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The performance evaluation is where you will investigate how to make your 
program more efficient using the skills you've learned in class. You must have
performed at least one experiment on your code to investigate the positive or
negative effects on performance. 

We encourage you to get creative with your tweaks. Consider places in your code
that could be considered bottlenecks and try to improve them. 

Each student should provide no more than a one page summary of their
optimizations along with tables and or graphs to visually explain any
performance differences.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELF-GRADING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* On the submission date, email your grade, on a scale of 0 to 100, to Harmony,
  harmoli+cis565@seas.upenn.edu, with a one paragraph explanation.  Be concise and 
  realistic.  Recall that we reserve 30 points as a sanity check to adjust your 
  grade.  Your actual grade will be (0.7 * your grade) + (0.3 * our grade).  We 
  hope to only use this in extreme cases when your grade does not realistically 
  reflect your work - it is either too high or too low.  In most cases, we plan 
  to give you the exact grade you suggest.
* Projects are not weighted evenly, e.g., Project 0 doesn't count as much as 
  the path tracer.  We will determine the weighting at the end of the semester 
  based on the size of each project.

SUBMISSION
---
As with the previous projects, you should fork this project and work inside of
your fork. Upon completion, commit your finished project back to your fork, and
make a pull request to the master repository.  You should include a README.md
file in the root directory detailing the following

* A brief description of the project and specific features you implemented
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A link to a video of your project running.
* Instructions for building and running your project if they differ from the
  base code.
* A performance writeup as detailed above.
* A list of all third-party code used.
* This Readme file edited as described above in the README section.

Many thanks to Cheng-Tso Lin, whose framework for CIS700 we used for this
assignment.

This project makes use of [three.js](http://www.threejs.org).
